cwe: CWE-1073
name: Non-SQL Invokable Control Element with Excessive Number of Data Resource Accesses
languages: SQL
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product contains a client with a function or method that contains a large number of
data accesses/queries that are sent through a data manager, i.e., does not use efficient
database capabilities.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Performance

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This issue can make the product perform more slowly. If the relevant code is reachable by
an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability. While the
interpretation of large number of data accesses/queries may vary for each product or
developer, CISQ recommends a default maximum of 2 data accesses per function/method.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
