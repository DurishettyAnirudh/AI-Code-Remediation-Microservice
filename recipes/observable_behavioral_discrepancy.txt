cwe: CWE-205
name: Observable Behavioral Discrepancy
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product's behaviors indicate important differences that may be observed by
unauthorized actors in a way that reveals (1) its internal state or decision process, or
(2) differences from other products with equivalent functionality.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Confidentiality:Access Control:Avoid situations leading toRead Application Data:Avoid situations leading toBypass Protection Mechanism

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Ideally, a product should provide as little information about its internal operations as
possible. Otherwise, attackers could use knowledge of these internal operations to
simplify or optimize their attack. In some cases, behavioral discrepancies can be used by
attackers to form a side channel.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
