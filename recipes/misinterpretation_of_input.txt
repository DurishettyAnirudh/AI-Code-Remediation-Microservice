cwe: CWE-115
name: Misinterpretation of Input
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product misinterprets an input, whether from an attacker or another product, in a
security-relevant fashion.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Integrity:Avoid situations leading toUnexpected State

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
::METHOD:Fuzzing:DESCRIPTION:Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a powerful technique for generating
large numbers of diverse inputs - either randomly or algorithmically - and dynamically
invoking the code with those inputs. Even with random inputs, it is often capable of
generating unexpected results such as crashes, memory corruption, or resource consumption.
Fuzzing effectively produces repeatable test cases that clearly indicate bugs, which helps
developers to diagnose the issues.:EFFECTIVENESS:High::

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
