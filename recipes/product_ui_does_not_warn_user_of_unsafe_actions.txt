cwe: CWE-356
name: Product UI does not Warn User of Unsafe Actions
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product's user interface does not warn the user before undertaking an unsafe action on
behalf of that user. This makes it easier for attackers to trick users into inflicting
damage to their system.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Non-Repudiation:Avoid situations leading toHide Activities

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Product systems should warn users that a potentially dangerous action may occur if the
user proceeds. For example, if the user downloads a file from an unknown source and
attempts to execute the file on their machine, then the application's GUI can indicate
that the file is unsafe.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
