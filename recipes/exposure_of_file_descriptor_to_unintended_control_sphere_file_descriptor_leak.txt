cwe: CWE-403
name: Exposure of File Descriptor to Unintended Control Sphere ('File Descriptor Leak')
languages: C
tags: Base, Draft, Program Invocation
---
Short Description:
A process does not close sensitive file descriptors before invoking a child process, which
allows the child to perform unauthorized I/O operations using those descriptors.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Confidentiality:Integrity:Avoid situations leading toRead Application Data:Avoid situations leading toModify Application Data

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
When a new process is forked or executed, the child process inherits any open file
descriptors. When the child process has fewer privileges than the parent process, this
might introduce a vulnerability if the child process can access the file descriptor but
does not have the privileges to access the associated file.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
