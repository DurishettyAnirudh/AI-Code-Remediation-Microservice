cwe: CWE-191
name: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
languages: C, C++, Java, C#
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the
minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct
result.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Availability:Avoid situations leading toDoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:Avoid situations leading toDoS: Resource Consumption (CPU):Avoid situations leading toDoS: Resource Consumption (Memory):Avoid situations leading toDoS: Instability:NOTE:This weakness will generally lead to undefined behavior and therefore crashes. In the case of overflows involving loop index variables, the likelihood of infinite loops is also high.
- Integrity:Avoid situations leading toModify Memory:NOTE:If the value in question is important to data (as opposed to flow), simple data corruption has occurred. Also, if the wrap around results in other conditions such as buffer overflows, further memory corruption may occur.
- Confidentiality:Availability:Access Control:Avoid situations leading toExecute Unauthorized Code or Commands:Avoid situations leading toBypass Protection Mechanism:NOTE:This weakness can sometimes trigger buffer overflows which can be used to execute arbitrary code. This is usually outside the scope of a program's implicit security policy.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This can happen in signed and unsigned cases.

::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly
referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching
for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks
(destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the
OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
