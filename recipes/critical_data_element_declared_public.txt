cwe: CWE-766
name: Critical Data Element Declared Public
languages: C++, C#, Java
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product declares a critical variable, field, or member to be public when intended
security policy requires it to be private.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Implementation:Data should be private, static, and final whenever possible. This will assure that your code is protected by instantiating early, preventing access, and preventing tampering.
Don't:
- Integrity:Confidentiality:Avoid situations leading toRead Application Data:Avoid situations leading toModify Application Data:NOTE:Making a critical variable public allows anyone with access to the object in which the variable is contained to alter or read the value.
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Maintainability

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly affects
security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities.
It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.

::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly
referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching
for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks
(destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the
OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::

::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Data should be private, static, and final whenever
possible. This will assure that your code is protected by instantiating early, preventing
access, and preventing tampering.::

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
