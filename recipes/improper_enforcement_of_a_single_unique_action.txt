cwe: CWE-837
name: Improper Enforcement of a Single, Unique Action
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product requires that an actor should only be able to perform an action once, or to
have only one unique action, but the product does not enforce or improperly enforces this
restriction.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toVaries by Context:NOTE:An attacker might be able to gain advantage over other users by performing the action multiple times, or affect the correctness of the product.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
In various applications, a user is only expected to perform a certain action once, such as
voting, requesting a refund, or making a purchase. When this restriction is not enforced,
sometimes this can have security implications. For example, in a voting application, an
attacker could attempt to stuff the ballot box by voting multiple times. If these votes
are counted separately, then the attacker could directly affect who wins the vote. This
could have significant business impact depending on the purpose of the product.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
