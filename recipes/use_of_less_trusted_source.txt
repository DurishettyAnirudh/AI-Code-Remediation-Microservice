cwe: CWE-348
name: Use of Less Trusted Source
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
The product has two different sources of the same data or information, but it uses the
source that has less support for verification, is less trusted, or is less resistant to
attack.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Access Control:Avoid situations leading toBypass Protection Mechanism:Avoid situations leading toGain Privileges or Assume Identity:NOTE:An attacker could utilize the untrusted data source to bypass protection mechanisms and gain access to sensitive data.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Document detection techniques and mitigation steps for this weakness.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
