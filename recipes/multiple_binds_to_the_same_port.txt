cwe: CWE-605
name: Multiple Binds to the Same Port
languages: unspecified
tags: Draft, Variant
---
Short Description:
When multiple sockets are allowed to bind to the same port, other services on that port
may be stolen or spoofed.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Policy:Restrict server socket address to known local addresses.
Don't:
- Confidentiality:Integrity:Avoid situations leading toRead Application Data:NOTE:Packets from a variety of network services may be stolen or the services spoofed.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
On most systems, a combination of setting the SO_REUSEADDR socket option, and a call to
bind() allows any process to bind to a port to which a previous process has bound with
INADDR_ANY. This allows a user to bind to the specific address of a server bound to
INADDR_ANY on an unprivileged port, and steal its UDP packets/TCP connection.

::PHASE:Policy:DESCRIPTION:Restrict server socket address to known local addresses.::

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
