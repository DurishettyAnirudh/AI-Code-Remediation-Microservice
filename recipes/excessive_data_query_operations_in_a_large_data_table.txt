cwe: CWE-1049
name: Excessive Data Query Operations in a Large Data Table
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product performs a data query with a large number of joins and sub-queries on a large
data table.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Performance

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This issue can make the product perform more slowly. If the relevant code is reachable by
an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability. While the
interpretation of large data table and large number of joins or sub-queries may vary for
each product or developer, CISQ recommends a default of 1 million rows for a large data
table, a default minimum of 5 joins, and a default minimum of 3 sub-queries.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
