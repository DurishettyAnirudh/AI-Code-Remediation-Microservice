cwe: CWE-833
name: Deadlock
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each
other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Availability:Avoid situations leading toDoS: Resource Consumption (CPU):Avoid situations leading toDoS: Resource Consumption (Other):Avoid situations leading toDoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:NOTE:Each thread of execution will hang and prevent tasks from completing. In some cases, CPU consumption may occur if a lock check occurs in a tight loop.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Document detection techniques and mitigation steps for this weakness.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
