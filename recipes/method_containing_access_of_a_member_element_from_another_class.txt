Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Maintainability

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This issue suggests poor encapsulation and makes it more difficult to understand and
maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or
time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to
introduce vulnerabilities.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
