cwe: CWE-1054
name: Invocation of a Control Element at an Unnecessarily Deep Horizontal Layer
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The code at one architectural layer invokes code that resides at a deeper layer than the
adjacent layer, i.e., the invocation skips at least one layer, and the invoked code is not
part of a vertical utility layer that can be referenced from any horizontal layer.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Maintainability

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This issue makes it more difficult to understand and maintain the product, which
indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or
fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
