cwe: CWE-1024
name: Comparison of Incompatible Types
languages: JavaScript, PHP
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product performs a comparison between two entities, but the entities are of different,
incompatible types that cannot be guaranteed to provide correct results when they are
directly compared.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Testing:Thoroughly test the comparison scheme before deploying code into production. Perform positive testing as well as negative testing.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toVaries by Context

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
In languages that are strictly typed but support casting/conversion, such as C or C++, the
programmer might assume that casting one entity to the same type as another entity will
ensure that the comparison will be performed correctly, but this cannot be guaranteed. In
languages that are not strictly typed, such as PHP or JavaScript, there may be implicit
casting/conversion to a type that the programmer is unaware of, causing unexpected
results; for example, the string 123 might be converted to a number type. See examples.

::PHASE:Testing:DESCRIPTION:Thoroughly test the comparison scheme before deploying code
into production. Perform positive testing as well as negative testing.::

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
