cwe: CWE-1060
name: Excessive Number of Inefficient Server-Side Data Accesses
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product performs too many data queries without using efficient data processing
functionality such as stored procedures.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Performance

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This issue can make the product perform more slowly due to computational expense. If the
relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a
vulnerability. While the interpretation of too many data queries may vary for each product
or developer, CISQ recommends a default maximum of 5 data queries for an inefficient
function/procedure.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
