cwe: CWE-374
name: Passing Mutable Objects to an Untrusted Method
languages: C, C++, Java, C#
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
The product sends non-cloned mutable data as an argument to a method or function.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Implementation:Pass in data which should not be altered as constant or immutable.
- PHASE:Implementation:Clone all mutable data before passing it into an external function . This is the preferred mitigation. This way, regardless of what changes are made to the data, a valid copy is retained for use by the class.
Don't:
- Integrity:Avoid situations leading toModify Memory:NOTE:Potentially data could be tampered with by another function which should not have been tampered with.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
The function or method that has been called can alter or delete the mutable data. This
could violate assumptions that the calling function has made about its state. In
situations where unknown code is called with references to mutable data, this external
code could make changes to the data sent. If this data was not previously cloned, the
modified data might not be valid in the context of execution.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
