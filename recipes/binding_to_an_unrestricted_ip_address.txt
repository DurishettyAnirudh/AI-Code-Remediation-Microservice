cwe: CWE-1327
name: Binding to an Unrestricted IP Address
languages: Other
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product assigns the address 0.0.0.0 for a database server, a cloud service/instance,
or any computing resource that communicates remotely.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:System Configuration:Assign IP addresses that are not 0.0.0.0.:EFFECTIVENESS:High
- PHASE:System Configuration:Firewall:Unwanted connections to the configured server may be denied through a firewall or other packet filtering measures.:EFFECTIVENESS:High
Don't:
- Availability:Avoid situations leading toDoS: Amplification:LIKELIHOOD:High

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
When a server binds to the address 0.0.0.0, it allows connections from every IP address on
the local machine, effectively exposing the server to every possible network. This might
be much broader access than intended by the developer or administrator, who might only be
expecting the server to be reachable from a single interface/network.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):

    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
