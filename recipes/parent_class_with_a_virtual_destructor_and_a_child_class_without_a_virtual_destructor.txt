cwe: CWE-1045
name: Parent Class with a Virtual Destructor and a Child Class without a Virtual Destructor
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
A parent class has a virtual destructor method, but the parent has a child class that does
not have a virtual destructor.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Reliability

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This issue can prevent the product from running reliably, since the child might not
perform essential destruction operations. If the relevant code is reachable by an
attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability, such as a memory
leak (CWE-401).

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
