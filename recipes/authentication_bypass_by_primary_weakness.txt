cwe: CWE-305
name: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
The authentication algorithm is sound, but the implemented mechanism can be bypassed as
the result of a separate weakness that is primary to the authentication error.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Access Control:Avoid situations leading toBypass Protection Mechanism

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Document detection techniques and mitigation steps for this weakness.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
