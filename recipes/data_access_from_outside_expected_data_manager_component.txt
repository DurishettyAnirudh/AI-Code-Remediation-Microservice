cwe: CWE-1083
name: Data Access from Outside Expected Data Manager Component
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product is intended to manage data access through a particular data manager component
such as a relational or non-SQL database, but it contains code that performs data access
operations without using that component.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Reliability

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
When the product has a data access component, the design may be intended to handle all
data access operations through that component. If a data access operation is performed
outside of that component, then this may indicate a violation of the intended design. This
issue can prevent the product from running reliably. If the relevant code is reachable by
an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
