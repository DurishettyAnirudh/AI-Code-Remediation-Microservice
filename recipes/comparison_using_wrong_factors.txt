cwe: CWE-1025
name: Comparison Using Wrong Factors
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The code performs a comparison between two entities, but the comparison examines the wrong
factors or characteristics of the entities, which can lead to incorrect results and
resultant weaknesses.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Testing:Thoroughly test the comparison scheme before deploying code into production. Perform positive testing as well as negative testing.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toVaries by Context

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This can lead to incorrect results and resultant weaknesses. For example, the code might
inadvertently compare references to objects, instead of the relevant contents of those
objects, causing two equal objects to be considered unequal.

::PHASE:Testing:DESCRIPTION:Thoroughly test the comparison scheme before deploying code
into production. Perform positive testing as well as negative testing.::

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
