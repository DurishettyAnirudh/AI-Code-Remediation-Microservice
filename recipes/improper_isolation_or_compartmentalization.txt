cwe: CWE-653
name: Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization
languages: unspecified
tags: Class, Draft
---
Short Description:
The product does not properly compartmentalize or isolate functionality, processes, or
resources that require different privilege levels, rights, or permissions.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Architecture and Design:Break up privileges between different modules, objects, or entities. Minimize the interfaces between modules and require strong access control between them.
Don't:
- Access Control:Avoid situations leading toGain Privileges or Assume Identity:Avoid situations leading toBypass Protection Mechanism:NOTE:The exploitation of a weakness in low-privileged areas of the software can be leveraged to reach higher-privileged areas without having to overcome any additional obstacles.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
When a weakness occurs in functionality that is accessible by lower-privileged users, then
without strong boundaries, an attack might extend the scope of the damage to higher-
privileged users.

::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the
following detection techniques may be useful: Cost effective for partial coverage: Compare
binary / bytecode to application permission manifest:EFFECTIVENESS:SOAR

Review:DESCRIPTION:According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:
Highly cost effective: Inspection (IEEE 1028 standard) (can apply to requirements, design,
source code, etc.) Formal Methods / Correct-By-Construction Cost effective for partial

control between them.::

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
