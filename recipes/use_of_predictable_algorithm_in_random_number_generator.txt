cwe: CWE-1241
name: Use of Predictable Algorithm in Random Number Generator
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
The device uses an algorithm that is predictable and generates a pseudo-random number.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Architecture and Design:A true random number generator should be specified for cryptographic algorithms.
- PHASE:Implementation:A true random number generator should be implemented for cryptographic algorithms.
Don't:
- Confidentiality:Avoid situations leading toRead Application Data:LIKELIHOOD:High

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Pseudo-random number generator algorithms are predictable because their registers have a
finite number of possible states, which eventually lead to repeating patterns. As a
result, pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) can compromise their randomness or expose
their internal state to various attacks, such as reverse engineering or tampering. It is
highly recommended to use hardware-based true random number generators (TRNGs) to ensure
the security of encryption schemes. TRNGs generate unpredictable, unbiased, and
independent random numbers because they employ physical phenomena, e.g., electrical noise,
as sources to generate random numbers.
