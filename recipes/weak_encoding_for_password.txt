cwe: CWE-261
name: Weak Encoding for Password
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
Obscuring a password with a trivial encoding does not protect the password.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Passwords should be encrypted with keys that are at least 128 bits in length for adequate security.
Don't:
- Access Control:Avoid situations leading toGain Privileges or Assume Identity

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an
application's properties or configuration file. A programmer can attempt to remedy the
password management problem by obscuring the password with an encoding function, such as
base 64 encoding, but this effort does not adequately protect the password.

::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly
referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching
for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks
(destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the
OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::

::PHASE::DESCRIPTION:Passwords should be encrypted with keys that are at least 128 bits in
length for adequate security.::

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
