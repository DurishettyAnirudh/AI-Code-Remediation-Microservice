cwe: CWE-695
name: Use of Low-Level Functionality
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product uses low-level functionality that is explicitly prohibited by the framework or
specification under which the product is supposed to operate.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toOther

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
The use of low-level functionality can violate the specification in unexpected ways that
effectively disable built-in protection mechanisms, introduce exploitable inconsistencies,
or otherwise expose the functionality to attack.

::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly
referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching
for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks
(destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the
OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
