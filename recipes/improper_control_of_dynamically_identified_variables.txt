cwe: CWE-914
name: Improper Control of Dynamically-Identified Variables
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product does not properly restrict reading from or writing to dynamically-identified
variables.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Implementation:Input Validation:For any externally-influenced input, check the input against an allowlist of internal program variables that are allowed to be modified.
- PHASE:Implementation Architecture and Design:Refactoring:Refactor the code so that internal program variables do not need to be dynamically identified.
Don't:
- Integrity:Avoid situations leading toModify Application Data:NOTE:An attacker could modify sensitive data or program variables.
- Integrity:Avoid situations leading toExecute Unauthorized Code or Commands
- Other:Integrity:Avoid situations leading toVaries by Context:Avoid situations leading toAlter Execution Logic

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Many languages offer powerful features that allow the programmer to access arbitrary
variables that are specified by an input string. While these features can offer
significant flexibility and reduce development time, they can be extremely dangerous if
attackers can modify unintended variables that have security implications.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
