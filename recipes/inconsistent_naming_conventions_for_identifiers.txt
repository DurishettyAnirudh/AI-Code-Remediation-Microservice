cwe: CWE-1099
name: Inconsistent Naming Conventions for Identifiers
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product's code, documentation, or other artifacts do not consistently use the same
naming conventions for variables, callables, groups of related callables, I/O
capabilities, data types, file names, or similar types of elements.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Never trust unbounded input and do not bypass centralized validation.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This issue makes it more difficult to understand and/or maintain the product due to
inconsistencies, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-
consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce
vulnerabilities.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
