cwe: CWE-483
name: Incorrect Block Delimitation
languages: C, C++
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
The code does not explicitly delimit a block that is intended to contain 2 or more
statements, creating a logic error.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Implementation:Always use explicit block delimitation and use static-analysis technologies to enforce this practice.
Don't:
- Confidentiality:Integrity:Availability:Avoid situations leading toAlter Execution Logic:NOTE:This is a general logic error which will often lead to obviously-incorrect behaviors that are quickly noticed and fixed. In lightly tested or untested code, this error may be introduced it into a production environment and provide additional attack vectors by creating a control flow path leading to an unexpected state in the application. The consequences will depend on the types of behaviors that are being incorrectly executed.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
In some languages, braces (or other delimiters) are optional for blocks. When the
delimiter is omitted, it is possible to insert a logic error in which a statement is
thought to be in a block but is not. In some cases, the logic error can have security
implications.

::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly
referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching
for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks
(destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the
OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::

::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Always use explicit block delimitation and use static-
analysis technologies to enforce this practice.::

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
