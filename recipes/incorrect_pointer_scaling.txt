cwe: CWE-468
name: Incorrect Pointer Scaling
languages: C, C++
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
In C and C++, one may often accidentally refer to the wrong memory due to the semantics of
when math operations are implicitly scaled.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Architecture and Design:Use a platform with high-level memory abstractions.
- PHASE:Implementation:Always use array indexing instead of direct pointer manipulation.
- PHASE:Architecture and Design:Use technologies for preventing buffer overflows.
Don't:
- Confidentiality:Integrity:Avoid situations leading toRead Memory:Avoid situations leading toModify Memory:NOTE:Incorrect pointer scaling will often result in buffer overflow conditions. Confidentiality can be compromised if the weakness is in the context of a buffer over-read or under-read.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):

# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
