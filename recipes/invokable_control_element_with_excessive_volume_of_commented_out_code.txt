cwe: CWE-1085
name: Invokable Control Element with Excessive Volume of Commented-out Code
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
A function, method, procedure, etc. contains an excessive amount of code that has been
commented out within its body.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Maintainability

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly affects
security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities.
It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities. While the interpretation of
excessive volume may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a default
threshold of 2% of commented code.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
