cwe: CWE-1089
name: Large Data Table with Excessive Number of Indices
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product uses a large data table that contains an excessively large number of indices.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Performance

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This issue can make the product perform more slowly. If the relevant code is reachable by
an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability. While the
interpretation of large data table and excessively large number of indices may vary for
each product or developer, CISQ recommends a default threshold of 1000000 rows for a large
table and a default threshold of 3 indices.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
