cwe: CWE-841
name: Improper Enforcement of Behavioral Workflow
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product supports a session in which more than one behavior must be performed by an
actor, but it does not properly ensure that the actor performs the behaviors in the
required sequence.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toAlter Execution Logic:NOTE:An attacker could cause the product to skip critical steps or perform them in the wrong order, bypassing its intended business logic. This can sometimes have security implications.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
By performing actions in an unexpected order, or by omitting steps, an attacker could
manipulate the business logic of the product or cause it to enter an invalid state. In
some cases, this can also expose resultant weaknesses. For example, a file-sharing
protocol might require that an actor perform separate steps to provide a username, then a
password, before being able to transfer files. If the file-sharing server accepts a
password command followed by a transfer command, without any username being provided, the
product might still perform the transfer. Note that this is different than CWE-696, which
focuses on when the product performs actions in the wrong sequence; this entry is closely
related, but it is focused on ensuring that the actor performs actions in the correct
sequence. Workflow-related behaviors include: Steps are performed in the expected order.
Required steps are not omitted. Steps are not interrupted. Steps are performed in a timely
fashion.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
