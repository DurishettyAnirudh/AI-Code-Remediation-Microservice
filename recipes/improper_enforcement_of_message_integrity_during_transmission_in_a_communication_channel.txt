cwe: CWE-924
name: Improper Enforcement of Message Integrity During Transmission in a Communication Channel
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product establishes a communication channel with an endpoint and receives a message
from that endpoint, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the message was not modified
during transmission.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Integrity:Confidentiality:Avoid situations leading toGain Privileges or Assume Identity:NOTE:If an attackers can spoof the endpoint, the attacker gains all the privileges that were intended for the original endpoint.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Attackers might be able to modify the message and spoof the endpoint by interfering with
the data as it crosses the network or by redirecting the connection to a system under
their control.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
