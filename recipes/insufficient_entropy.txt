cwe: CWE-331
name: Insufficient Entropy
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
The product uses an algorithm or scheme that produces insufficient entropy, leaving
patterns or clusters of values that are more likely to occur than others.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Implementation:Determine the necessary entropy to adequately provide for randomness and predictability. This can be achieved by increasing the number of bits of objects such as keys and seeds.
Don't:
- Access Control:Other:Avoid situations leading toBypass Protection Mechanism:Avoid situations leading toOther:NOTE:An attacker could guess the random numbers generated and could gain unauthorized access to a system if the random numbers are used for authentication and authorization.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
