cwe: CWE-1037
name: Processor Optimization Removal or Modification of Security-critical Code
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The developer builds a security-critical protection mechanism into the software, but the
processor optimizes the execution of the program such that the mechanism is removed or
modified.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Integrity:Avoid situations leading toBypass Protection Mechanism:LIKELIHOOD:High:NOTE:A successful exploitation of this weakness will change the order of an application's execution and will likely be used to bypass specific protection mechanisms. This bypass can be exploited further to potentially read data that should otherwise be unaccessible.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
::METHOD:White Box:DESCRIPTION:In theory this weakness can be detected through the use of
white box testing techniques where specifically crafted test cases are used in conjunction
with debuggers to verify the order of statements being
executed.:EFFECTIVENESS:Opportunistic::

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
