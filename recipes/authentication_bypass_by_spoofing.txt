cwe: CWE-290
name: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
This attack-focused weakness is caused by incorrectly implemented authentication schemes
that are subject to spoofing attacks.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Access Control:Avoid situations leading toBypass Protection Mechanism:Avoid situations leading toGain Privileges or Assume Identity:NOTE:This weakness can allow an attacker to access resources which are not otherwise accessible without proper authentication.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Document detection techniques and mitigation steps for this weakness.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
