cwe: CWE-1070
name: Serializable Data Element Containing non-Serializable Item Elements
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product contains a serializable, storable data element such as a field or member, but
the data element contains member elements that are not serializable.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Reliability

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This issue can prevent the product from running reliably. If the relevant code is
reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability.
As examples, the serializable nature of a data element comes from a serializable
SerializableAttribute attribute in .NET and the inheritance from the java.io.Serializable
interface in Java.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
