cwe: CWE-253
name: Incorrect Check of Function Return Value
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product incorrectly checks a return value from a function, which prevents it from
detecting errors or exceptional conditions.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Architecture and Design:Language Selection:Use a language or compiler that uses exceptions and requires the catching of those exceptions.
- PHASE:Implementation:Properly check all functions which return a value.
- PHASE:Implementation:When designing any function make sure you return a value or throw an exception in case of an error.
Don't:
- Availability:Integrity:Avoid situations leading toUnexpected State:Avoid situations leading toDoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:NOTE:An unexpected return value could place the system in a state that could lead to a crash or other unintended behaviors.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Important and common functions will return some value about the success of its actions.
This will alert the program whether or not to handle any errors caused by that function.

if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
