cwe: CWE-477
name: Use of Obsolete Function
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
The code uses deprecated or obsolete functions, which suggests that the code has not been
actively reviewed or maintained.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Implementation:Refer to the documentation for the obsolete function in order to determine why it is deprecated or obsolete and to learn about alternative ways to achieve the same functionality.
- PHASE:Requirements:Consider seriously the security implications of using an obsolete function. Consider using alternate functions.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toQuality Degradation

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
As programming languages evolve, functions occasionally become obsolete due to: Advances
in the language Improved understanding of how operations should be performed effectively
and securely Changes in the conventions that govern certain operations Functions that are
removed are usually replaced by newer counterparts that perform the same task in some
different and hopefully improved way.
