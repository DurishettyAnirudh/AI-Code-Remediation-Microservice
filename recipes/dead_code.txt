cwe: CWE-561
name: Dead Code
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
The product contains dead code, which can never be executed.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Implementation:Remove dead code before deploying the application.
- PHASE:Testing:Use a static analysis tool to spot dead code.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toQuality Degradation:NOTE:Dead code that results from code that can never be executed is an indication of problems with the source code that needs to be fixed and is an indication of poor quality.
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Maintainability

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Dead code is code that can never be executed in a running program. The surrounding code
makes it impossible for a section of code to ever be executed.
