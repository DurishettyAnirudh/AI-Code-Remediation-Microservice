cwe: CWE-489
name: Active Debug Code
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Draft

Short Description:
The product is released with debugging code still enabled or active.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Build and Compilation Distribution:Remove debug code before deploying the application.
Don't:
- Confidentiality:Integrity:Availability:Access Control:Other:Avoid situations leading toBypass Protection Mechanism:Avoid situations leading toRead Application Data:Avoid situations leading toGain Privileges or Assume Identity:Avoid situations leading toVaries by Context:NOTE:Active debug code can create unintended entry points or expose sensitive information. The severity of the exposed debug code will depend on the particular instance. At the least, it will give an attacker sensitive information about the settings and mechanics of web applications on the server. At worst, as is often the case, the debug code will allow an attacker complete control over the web application and server, as well as confidential information that either of these access.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly
referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching
for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks
(destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the
OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::

::PHASE:Build and Compilation Distribution:DESCRIPTION:Remove debug code before deploying
the application.::

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
