cwe: CWE-1082
name: Class Instance Self Destruction Control Element
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The code contains a class instance that calls the method or function to delete or destroy
itself.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Reliability

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
For example, in C++, delete this will cause the object to delete itself. This issue can
prevent the product from running reliably. If the relevant code is reachable by an
attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
