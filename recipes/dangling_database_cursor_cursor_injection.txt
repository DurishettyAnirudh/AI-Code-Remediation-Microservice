cwe: CWE-619
name: Dangling Database Cursor ('Cursor Injection')
languages: SQL
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
If a database cursor is not closed properly, then it could become accessible to other
users while retaining the same privileges that were originally assigned, leaving the
cursor dangling.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Implementation:Close cursors immediately after access to them is complete. Ensure that you close cursors if exceptions occur.
Don't:
- Confidentiality:Integrity:Avoid situations leading toRead Application Data:Avoid situations leading toModify Application Data

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
For example, an improper dangling cursor could arise from unhandled exceptions. The impact
of the issue depends on the cursor's role, but SQL injection attacks are commonly
possible.

::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Close cursors immediately after access to them is

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
