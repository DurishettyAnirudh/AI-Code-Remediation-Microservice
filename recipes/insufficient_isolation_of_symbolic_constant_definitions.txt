cwe: CWE-1107
name: Insufficient Isolation of Symbolic Constant Definitions
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The source code uses symbolic constants, but it does not sufficiently place the
definitions of these constants into a more centralized or isolated location.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Maintainability

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly affects
security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities.
It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
