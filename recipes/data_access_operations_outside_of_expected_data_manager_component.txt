cwe: CWE-1057
name: Data Access Operations Outside of Expected Data Manager Component
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product uses a dedicated, central data manager component as required by design, but it
contains code that performs data-access operations that do not use this data manager.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Performance

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This issue can make the product perform more slowly than intended, since the intended
central data manager may have been explicitly optimized for performance or other quality
characteristics. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance
problem might introduce a vulnerability.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
