channel is accessible to other actors.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This creates a race condition that allows an attacker to access the channel before the
authorized user does.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
