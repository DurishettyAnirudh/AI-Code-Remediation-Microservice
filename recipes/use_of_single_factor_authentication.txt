cwe: CWE-308
name: Use of Single-factor Authentication
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
The use of single-factor authentication can lead to unnecessary risk of compromise when
compared with the benefits of a dual-factor authentication scheme.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Architecture and Design:Use multiple independent authentication schemes, which ensures that -- if one of the methods is compromised -- the system itself is still likely safe from compromise.
Don't:
- Access Control:Avoid situations leading toBypass Protection Mechanism:NOTE:If the secret in a single-factor authentication scheme gets compromised, full authentication is possible.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
While the use of multiple authentication schemes is simply piling on more complexity on
top of authentication, it is inestimably valuable to have such measures of redundancy. The
use of weak, reused, and common passwords is rampant on the internet. Without the added
protection of multiple authentication schemes, a single mistake can result in the
compromise of an account. For this reason, if multiple schemes are possible and also easy
to use, they should be implemented and required.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
