cwe: CWE-842
name: Placement of User into Incorrect Group
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product or the administrator places a user into an incorrect group.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Access Control:Avoid situations leading toGain Privileges or Assume Identity

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
If the incorrect group has more access or privileges than the intended group, the user
might be able to bypass intended security policy to access unexpected resources or perform
unexpected actions. The access-control system might not be able to detect malicious usage
of this group membership.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
