cwe: CWE-303
name: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication
algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Access Control:Avoid situations leading toBypass Protection Mechanism

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This incorrect implementation may allow authentication to be bypassed.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
