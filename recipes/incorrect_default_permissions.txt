cwe: CWE-276
name: Incorrect Default Permissions
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
During installation, installed file permissions are set to allow anyone to modify those
files.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Architecture and Design Operation:The architecture needs to access and modification attributes for files to only those users who actually require those actions.
- PHASE:Architecture and Design:Separation of Privilege:Compartmentalize the system to have safe areas where trust boundaries can be unambiguously drawn. Do not allow sensitive data to go outside of the trust boundary and always be careful when interfacing with a compartment outside of the safe area. Ensure that appropriate compartmentalization is built into the system design, and the compartmentalization allows for and reinforces privilege separation functionality. Architects and designers should rely on the principle of least privilege to decide the appropriate time to use privileges and the time to drop privileges.
Don't:
- Confidentiality:Integrity:Avoid situations leading toRead Application Data:Avoid situations leading toModify Application Data

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):

if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
