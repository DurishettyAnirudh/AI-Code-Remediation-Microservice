cwe: CWE-1086
name: Class with Excessive Number of Child Classes
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
A class contains an unnecessarily large number of children.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Maintainability

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This issue makes it more difficult to understand and maintain the software, which
indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or
fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities. While the
interpretation of large number of children may vary for each product or developer, CISQ
recommends a default maximum of 10 child classes.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
