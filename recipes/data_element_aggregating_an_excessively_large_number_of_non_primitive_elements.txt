cwe: CWE-1043
name: Data Element Aggregating an Excessively Large Number of Non-Primitive Elements
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product uses a data element that has an excessively large number of sub-elements with
non-primitive data types such as structures or aggregated objects.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Performance

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This issue can make the product perform more slowly. If the relevant code is reachable by
an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability. While the
interpretation of excessively large may vary for each product or developer, CISQ
recommends a default of 5 sub-elements.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
