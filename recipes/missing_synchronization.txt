cwe: CWE-820
name: Missing Synchronization
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product utilizes a shared resource in a concurrent manner but does not attempt to
synchronize access to the resource.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Integrity:Confidentiality:Other:Avoid situations leading toModify Application Data:Avoid situations leading toRead Application Data:Avoid situations leading toAlter Execution Logic

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
If access to a shared resource is not synchronized, then the resource may not be in a
state that is expected by the product. This might lead to unexpected or insecure
behaviors, especially if an attacker can influence the shared resource.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
