cwe: CWE-1236
name: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product saves user-provided information into a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file, but
it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be
interpreted as a command when the file is opened by a spreadsheet product.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Implementation:When generating CSV output, ensure that formula-sensitive metacharacters are effectively escaped or removed from all data before storage in the resultant CSV. Risky characters include '=' (equal), '+' (plus), '-' (minus), and '@' (at).:EFFECTIVENESS:Moderate
- PHASE:Implementation:If a field starts with a formula character, prepend it with a ' (single apostrophe), which prevents Excel from executing the formula.:EFFECTIVENESS:Moderate
- PHASE:Architecture and Design:Certain implementations of spreadsheet software might disallow formulas from executing if the file is untrusted, or if the file is not authored by the current user.:EFFECTIVENESS:Limited
Don't:
- Confidentiality:Avoid situations leading toRead Application Data:Avoid situations leading toExecute Unauthorized Code or Commands:LIKELIHOOD:Low:NOTE:Current versions of Excel warn users of untrusted content.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
User-provided data is often saved to traditional databases. This data can be exported to a
CSV file, which allows users to read the data using spreadsheet software such as Excel,
Numbers, or Calc. This software interprets entries beginning with '=' as formulas, which
are then executed by the spreadsheet software. The software's formula language often
allows methods to access hyperlinks or the local command line, and frequently allows
enough characters to invoke an entire script. Attackers can populate data fields which,
when saved to a CSV file, may attempt information exfiltration or other malicious activity
when automatically executed by the spreadsheet software.
