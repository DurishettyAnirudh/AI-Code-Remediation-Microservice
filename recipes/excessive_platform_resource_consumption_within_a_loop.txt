cwe: CWE-1050
name: Excessive Platform Resource Consumption within a Loop
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product has a loop body or loop condition that contains a control element that
directly or indirectly consumes platform resources, e.g. messaging, sessions, locks, or
file descriptors.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Performance

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This issue can make the product perform more slowly. If an attacker can influence the
number of iterations in the loop, then this performance problem might allow a denial of
service by consuming more platform resources than intended.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
