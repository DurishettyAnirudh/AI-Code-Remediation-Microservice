cwe: CWE-606
name: Unchecked Input for Loop Condition
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
The product does not properly check inputs that are used for loop conditions, potentially
leading to a denial of service or other consequences because of excessive looping.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Implementation:Do not use user-controlled data for loop conditions.
- PHASE:Implementation:Perform input validation.
Don't:
- Availability:Avoid situations leading toDoS: Resource Consumption (CPU)

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly
referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching
for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks
(destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the
OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::

::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Do not use user-controlled data for loop
conditions.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Perform input validation.::

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
