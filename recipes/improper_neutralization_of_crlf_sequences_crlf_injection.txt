cwe: CWE-93
name: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
The product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate
lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences
from inputs.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Implementation:Avoid using CRLF as a special sequence.
- PHASE:Implementation:Appropriately filter or quote CRLF sequences in user-controlled input.
Don't:
- Integrity:Avoid situations leading toModify Application Data

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly
referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching
for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks
(destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the
OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
