Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Reliability

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This issue can prevent the product from running reliably. If the relevant code is
reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
