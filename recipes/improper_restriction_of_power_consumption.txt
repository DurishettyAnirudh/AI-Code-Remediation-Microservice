cwe: CWE-920
name: Improper Restriction of Power Consumption
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product operates in an environment in which power is a limited resource that cannot be
automatically replenished, but the product does not properly restrict the amount of power
that its operation consumes.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Availability:Avoid situations leading toDoS: Resource Consumption (Other):Avoid situations leading toDoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:NOTE:The power source could be drained, causing the application - and the entire device - to cease functioning.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
In environments such as embedded or mobile devices, power can be a limited resource such
as a battery, which cannot be automatically replenished by the product itself, and the
device might not always be directly attached to a reliable power source. If the product
uses too much power too quickly, then this could cause the device (and subsequently, the
product) to stop functioning until power is restored, or increase the financial burden on
the device owner because of increased power costs. Normal operation of an application will
consume power. However, in some cases, an attacker could cause the application to consume
more power than intended, using components such as: Display CPU Disk I/O GPS Sound
Microphone USB interface

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
