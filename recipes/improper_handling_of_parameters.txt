cwe: CWE-233
name: Improper Handling of Parameters
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product does not properly handle when the expected number of parameters, fields, or
arguments is not provided in input, or if those parameters are undefined.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Integrity:Avoid situations leading toUnexpected State

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
::METHOD:Fuzzing:DESCRIPTION:Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a powerful technique for generating
large numbers of diverse inputs - either randomly or algorithmically - and dynamically
invoking the code with those inputs. Even with random inputs, it is often capable of
generating unexpected results such as crashes, memory corruption, or resource consumption.
Fuzzing effectively produces repeatable test cases that clearly indicate bugs, which helps
developers to diagnose the issues.:EFFECTIVENESS:High::METHOD:Automated Static
Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application
Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code
(or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by
building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable
patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data
interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS,
etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
