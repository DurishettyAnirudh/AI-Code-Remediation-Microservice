cwe: CWE-1286
name: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a
certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies
with the syntax.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Implementation:Input Validation:Assume all input is malicious. Use an accept known good input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does. When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, boat may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as red or blue. Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.:EFFECTIVENESS:High

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Often, complex inputs are expected to follow a particular syntax, which is either assumed
by the input itself, or declared within metadata such as headers. The syntax could be for
data exchange formats, markup languages, or even programming languages. When untrusted
input is not properly validated for the expected syntax, attackers could cause parsing
failures, trigger unexpected errors, or expose latent vulnerabilities that might not be
directly exploitable if the input had conformed to the syntax.

::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY:Input Validation:DESCRIPTION:Assume all input is

    validate_against_allowlist()
