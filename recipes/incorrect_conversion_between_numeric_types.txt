cwe: CWE-681
name: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
languages: C
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
When converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be
omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values. If the resulting values
are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors may occur.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Implementation:Avoid making conversion between numeric types. Always check for the allowed ranges.
Don't:
- Other:Integrity:Avoid situations leading toUnexpected State:Avoid situations leading toQuality Degradation:NOTE:The program could wind up using the wrong number and generate incorrect results. If the number is used to allocate resources or make a security decision, then this could introduce a vulnerability.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Avoid making conversion between numeric types. Always
check for the allowed ranges.::

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
