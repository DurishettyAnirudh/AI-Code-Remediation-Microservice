cwe: CWE-1066
name: Missing Serialization Control Element
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product contains a serializable data element that does not have an associated
serialization method.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Reliability

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This issue can prevent the product from running reliably, e.g. by triggering an exception.
If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might
introduce a vulnerability. As examples, the serializable nature of a data element comes
from a serializable SerializableAttribute attribute in .NET and the inheritance from the
java.io.Serializable interface in Java.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
