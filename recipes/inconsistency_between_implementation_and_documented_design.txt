cwe: CWE-1068
name: Inconsistency Between Implementation and Documented Design
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The implementation of the product is not consistent with the design as described within
the relevant documentation.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Never trust unbounded input and do not bypass centralized validation.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product due to inconsistencies, which
indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or
fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
