cwe: CWE-324
name: Use of a Key Past its Expiration Date
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
The product uses a cryptographic key or password past its expiration date, which
diminishes its safety significantly by increasing the timing window for cracking attacks
against that key.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Architecture and Design:Adequate consideration should be put in to the user interface in order to notify users previous to the key's expiration, to explain the importance of new key generation and to walk users through the process as painlessly as possible.
Don't:
- Access Control:Avoid situations leading toBypass Protection Mechanism:Avoid situations leading toGain Privileges or Assume Identity:NOTE:The cryptographic key in question may be compromised, providing a malicious user with a method for authenticating as the victim.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
While the expiration of keys does not necessarily ensure that they are compromised, it is
a significant concern that keys which remain in use for prolonged periods of time have a
decreasing probability of integrity. For this reason, it is important to replace keys
within a period of time proportional to their strength.
