cwe: CWE-1047
name: Modules with Circular Dependencies
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product contains modules in which one module has references that cycle back to itself,
i.e., there are circular dependencies.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Reliability

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
As an example, with Java, this weakness might indicate cycles between packages. This issue
makes it more difficult to maintain the product due to insufficient modularity, which
indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or
fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities. This issue
can prevent the product from running reliably. If the relevant code is reachable by an
attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
