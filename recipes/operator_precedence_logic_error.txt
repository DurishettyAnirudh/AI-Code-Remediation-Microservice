cwe: CWE-783
name: Operator Precedence Logic Error
languages: C, C++
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
The product uses an expression in which operator precedence causes incorrect logic to be
used.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Implementation:Regularly wrap sub-expressions in parentheses, especially in security-critical code.
Don't:
- Confidentiality:Integrity:Availability:Avoid situations leading toVaries by Context:Avoid situations leading toUnexpected State:NOTE:The consequences will vary based on the context surrounding the incorrect precedence. In a security decision, integrity or confidentiality are the most likely results. Otherwise, a crash may occur due to the software reaching an unexpected state.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
While often just a bug, operator precedence logic errors can have serious consequences if
they are used in security-critical code, such as making an authentication decision.

::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Regularly wrap sub-expressions in parentheses,
especially in security-critical code.::

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
