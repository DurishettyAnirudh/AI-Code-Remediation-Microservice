cwe: CWE-480
name: Use of Incorrect Operator
languages: C, C++, Perl
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
The product accidentally uses the wrong operator, which changes the logic in security-
relevant ways.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toAlter Execution Logic:NOTE:This weakness can cause unintended logic to be executed and other unexpected application behavior.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
These types of errors are generally the result of a typo by the programmer.

::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:This weakness can be found easily using
static analysis. However in some cases an operator might appear to be incorrect, but is
actually correct and reflects unusual logic within the program.::METHOD:Manual Static

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
