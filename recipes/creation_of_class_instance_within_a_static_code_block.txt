cwe: CWE-1063
name: Creation of Class Instance within a Static Code Block
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
A static code block creates an instance of a class.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Performance

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This pattern identifies situations where a storable data element or member data element is
initialized with a value in a block of code which is declared as static. This issue can
make the product perform more slowly by performing initialization before it is needed. If
the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance problem might
introduce a vulnerability.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
