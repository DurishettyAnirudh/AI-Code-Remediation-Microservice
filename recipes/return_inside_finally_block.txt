cwe: CWE-584
name: Return Inside Finally Block
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
The code has a return statement inside a finally block, which will cause any thrown
exception in the try block to be discarded.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Implementation:Do not use a return statement inside the finally block. The finally block should have cleanup code.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toAlter Execution Logic

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly
referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching
for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks
(destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the
OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::

::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Do not use a return statement inside the finally block.
The finally block should have cleanup code.::

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
