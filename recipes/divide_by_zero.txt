cwe: CWE-369
name: Divide By Zero
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
The product divides a value by zero.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Availability:Avoid situations leading toDoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:NOTE:A Divide by Zero results in a crash.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This weakness typically occurs when an unexpected value is provided to the product, or if
an error occurs that is not properly detected. It frequently occurs in calculations
involving physical dimensions such as size, length, width, and height.

::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly
referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching
for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks
(destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the
OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::METHOD:Fuzzing:DESCRIPTION:Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a
powerful technique for generating large numbers of diverse inputs - either randomly or
algorithmically - and dynamically invoking the code with those inputs. Even with random
inputs, it is often capable of generating unexpected results such as crashes, memory
corruption, or resource consumption. Fuzzing effectively produces repeatable test cases
that clearly indicate bugs, which helps developers to diagnose the
issues.:EFFECTIVENESS:High::

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
