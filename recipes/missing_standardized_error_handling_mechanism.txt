cwe: CWE-544
name: Missing Standardized Error Handling Mechanism
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
The product does not use a standardized method for handling errors throughout the code,
which might introduce inconsistent error handling and resultant weaknesses.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Architecture and Design:define a strategy for handling errors of different severities, such as fatal errors versus basic log events. Use or create built-in language features, or an external package, that provides an easy-to-use API and define coding standards for the detection and handling of errors.
Don't:
- Integrity:Other:Avoid situations leading toQuality Degradation:Avoid situations leading toUnexpected State:Avoid situations leading toVaries by Context

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
If the product handles error messages individually, on a one-by-one basis, this is likely
to result in inconsistent error handling. The causes of errors may be lost. Also, detailed
information about the causes of an error may be unintentionally returned to the user.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
