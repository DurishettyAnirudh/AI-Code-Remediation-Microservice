cwe: CWE-1104
name: Use of Unmaintained Third Party Components
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product relies on third-party components that are not actively supported or maintained
by the original developer or a trusted proxy for the original developer.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Maintainability

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Reliance on components that are no longer maintained can make it difficult or impossible
to fix significant bugs, vulnerabilities, or quality issues. In effect, unmaintained code
can become obsolete. This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product, which
indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or
fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
