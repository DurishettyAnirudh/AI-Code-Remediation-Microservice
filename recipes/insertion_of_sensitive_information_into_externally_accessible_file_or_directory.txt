cwe: CWE-538
name: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to
actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Architecture and Design Operation System Configuration:Do not expose file and directory information to the user.
Don't:
- Confidentiality:Avoid situations leading toRead Files or Directories

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly
referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching
for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks
(destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the
OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::

::PHASE:Architecture and Design Operation System Configuration:DESCRIPTION:Do not expose
file and directory information to the user.::

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
