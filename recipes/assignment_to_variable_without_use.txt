cwe: CWE-563
name: Assignment to Variable without Use
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
The variable's value is assigned but never used, making it a dead store.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Implementation:Remove unused variables from the code.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toQuality Degradation:Avoid situations leading toVaries by Context:NOTE:This weakness could be an indication of a bug in the program or a deprecated variable that was not removed and is an indication of poor quality. This could lead to further bugs and the introduction of weaknesses.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
After the assignment, the variable is either assigned another value or goes out of scope.
It is likely that the variable is simply vestigial, but it is also possible that the
unused variable points out a bug.

::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly
referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching
for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks
(destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the
OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::

::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Remove unused variables from the code.::

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
