cwe: CWE-425
name: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all
restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Architecture and Design Operation:Apply appropriate access control authorizations for each access to all restricted URLs, scripts or files.
- PHASE:Architecture and Design:Consider using MVC based frameworks such as Struts.
Don't:
- Confidentiality:Integrity:Availability:Access Control:Avoid situations leading toRead Application Data:Avoid situations leading toModify Application Data:Avoid situations leading toExecute Unauthorized Code or Commands:Avoid situations leading toGain Privileges or Assume Identity

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Web applications susceptible to direct request attacks often make the false assumption
that such resources can only be reached through a given navigation path and so only apply
authorization at certain points in the path.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):

# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
