cwe: CWE-487
name: Reliance on Package-level Scope
languages: Java
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
Java packages are not inherently closed; therefore, relying on them for code security is
not a good practice.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Architecture and Design Implementation:Data should be private static and final whenever possible. This will assure that your code is protected by instantiating early, preventing access and tampering.
Don't:
- Confidentiality:Avoid situations leading toRead Application Data:NOTE:Any data in a Java package can be accessed outside of the Java framework if the package is distributed.
- Integrity:Avoid situations leading toModify Application Data:NOTE:The data in a Java class can be modified by anyone outside of the Java framework if the packages is distributed.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
The purpose of package scope is to prevent accidental access by other parts of a program.
This is an ease-of-software-development feature but not a security feature.

::PHASE:Architecture and Design Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Data should be private static

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
