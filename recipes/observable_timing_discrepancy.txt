cwe: CWE-208
name: Observable Timing Discrepancy
languages: unspecified
tags: Authentication, Base, Cryptography, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
Two separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a
way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the
state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Confidentiality:Access Control:Avoid situations leading toRead Application Data:Avoid situations leading toBypass Protection Mechanism

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
In security-relevant contexts, even small variations in timing can be exploited by
attackers to indirectly infer certain details about the product's internal operations. For
example, in some cryptographic algorithms, attackers can use timing differences to infer
certain properties about a private key, making the key easier to guess. Timing
discrepancies effectively form a timing side channel.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
