cwe: CWE-334
name: Small Space of Random Values
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
The number of possible random values is smaller than needed by the product, making it more
susceptible to brute force attacks.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Architecture and Design Requirements:Libraries or Frameworks:Use products or modules that conform to FIPS 140-2 [REF-267] to avoid obvious entropy problems. Consult FIPS 140-2 Annex C (Approved Random Number Generators).
Don't:
- Access Control:Other:Avoid situations leading toBypass Protection Mechanism:Avoid situations leading toOther:NOTE:An attacker could easily guess the values used. This could lead to unauthorized access to a system if the seed is used for authentication and authorization.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
