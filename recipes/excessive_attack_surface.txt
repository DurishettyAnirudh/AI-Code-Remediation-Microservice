cwe: CWE-1125
name: Excessive Attack Surface
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product has an attack surface whose quantitative measurement exceeds a desirable
maximum.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Never trust unbounded input and do not bypass centralized validation.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Originating from software security, an attack surface measure typically reflects the
number of input points and output points that can be utilized by an untrusted party, i.e.
a potential attacker. A larger attack surface provides more places to attack, and more
opportunities for developers to introduce weaknesses. In some cases, this measure may
reflect other aspects of quality besides security; e.g., a product with many inputs and
outputs may require a large number of tests in order to improve code coverage.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
