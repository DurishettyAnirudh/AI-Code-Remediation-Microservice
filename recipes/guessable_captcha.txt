Short Description:
The product uses a CAPTCHA challenge, but the challenge can be guessed or automatically
recognized by a non-human actor.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Access Control:Other:Avoid situations leading toBypass Protection Mechanism:Avoid situations leading toOther:NOTE:When authorization, authentication, or another protection mechanism relies on CAPTCHA entities to ensure that only human actors can access certain functionality, then an automated attacker such as a bot may access the restricted functionality by guessing the CAPTCHA.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
An automated attacker could bypass the intended protection of the CAPTCHA challenge and
perform actions at a higher frequency than humanly possible, such as launching spam
attacks. There can be several different causes of a guessable CAPTCHA: An audio or visual
image that does not have sufficient distortion from the unobfuscated source image. A
question is generated with a format that can be automatically recognized, such as a math
question. A question for which the number of possible answers is limited, such as birth
years or favorite sports teams. A general-knowledge or trivia question for which the
answer can be accessed using a data base, such as country capitals or popular
entertainers. Other data associated with the CAPTCHA may provide hints about its contents,
such as an image whose filename contains the word that is used in the CAPTCHA.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
