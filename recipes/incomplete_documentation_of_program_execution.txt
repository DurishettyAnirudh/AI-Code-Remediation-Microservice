cwe: CWE-1112
name: Incomplete Documentation of Program Execution
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The document does not fully define all mechanisms that are used to control or influence
how product-specific programs are executed.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Never trust unbounded input and do not bypass centralized validation.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This includes environmental variables, configuration files, registry keys, command-line
switches or options, or system settings.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
