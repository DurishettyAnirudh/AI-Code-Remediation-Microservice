cwe: CWE-1105
name: Insufficient Encapsulation of Machine-Dependent Functionality
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product or code uses machine-dependent functionality, but it does not sufficiently
encapsulate or isolate this functionality from the rest of the code.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Maintainability

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This issue makes it more difficult to port or maintain the product, which indirectly
affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix
vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
