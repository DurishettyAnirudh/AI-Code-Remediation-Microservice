cwe: CWE-1041
name: Use of Redundant Code
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product has multiple functions, methods, procedures, macros, etc. that contain the
same code.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Implementation:Merge common functionality into a single function and then call that function from across the entire code base.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Maintainability

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly affects
security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities.
For example, if there are two copies of the same code, the programmer might fix a weakness
in one copy while forgetting to fix the same weakness in another copy.

::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Merge common functionality into a single function and
then call that function from across the entire code base.::

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
