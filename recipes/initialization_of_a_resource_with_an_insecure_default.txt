cwe: CWE-1188
name: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product initializes or sets a resource with a default that is intended to be changed
by the administrator, but the default is not secure.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Never trust unbounded input and do not bypass centralized validation.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Developers often choose default values that leave the product as open and easy to use as
possible out-of-the-box, under the assumption that the administrator can (or should)
change the default value. However, this ease-of-use comes at a cost when the default is
insecure and the administrator does not change it.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
