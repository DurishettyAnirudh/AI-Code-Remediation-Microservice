cwe: CWE-910
name: Use of Expired File Descriptor
languages: C, C++
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product uses or accesses a file descriptor after it has been closed.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Confidentiality:Avoid situations leading toRead Files or Directories:NOTE:The program could read data from the wrong file.
- Availability:Avoid situations leading toDoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:NOTE:Accessing a file descriptor that has been closed can cause a crash.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
After a file descriptor for a particular file or device has been released, it can be
reused. The code might not write to the original file, since the reused file descriptor
might reference a different file or device.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
