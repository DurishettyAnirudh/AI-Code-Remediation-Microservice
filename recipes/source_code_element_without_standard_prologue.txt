cwe: CWE-1115
name: Source Code Element without Standard Prologue
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The source code contains elements such as source files that do not consistently provide a
prologue or header that has been standardized for the project.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Never trust unbounded input and do not bypass centralized validation.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
The lack of a prologue can make it more difficult to accurately and quickly understand the
associated code. Standard prologues or headers may contain information such as module
name, version number, author, date, purpose, function, assumptions, limitations, accuracy
considerations, etc. This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product due to
insufficient analyzability, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult
or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to
introduce vulnerabilities.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
