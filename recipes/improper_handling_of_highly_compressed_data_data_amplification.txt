cwe: CWE-409
name: Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data (Data Amplification)
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles a compressed input with a very high
compression ratio that produces a large output.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Availability:Avoid situations leading toDoS: Amplification:Avoid situations leading toDoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:Avoid situations leading toDoS: Resource Consumption (CPU):Avoid situations leading toDoS: Resource Consumption (Memory):NOTE:System resources, CPU and memory, can be quickly consumed. This can lead to poor system performance or system crash.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
An example of data amplification is a decompression bomb, a small ZIP file that can
produce a large amount of data when it is decompressed.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
