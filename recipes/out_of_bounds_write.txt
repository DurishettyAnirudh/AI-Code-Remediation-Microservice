cwe: CWE-787
name: Out-of-bounds Write
languages: C, C++
tags: Base, Draft, Memory Management
---
Short Description:
The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Requirements:Language Selection:Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid. For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer. Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.
- PHASE:Architecture and Design:Libraries or Frameworks:Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid. Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone string-handling functions.
- PHASE:Operation Build and Compilation:Environment Hardening:Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking. D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail.:EFFECTIVENESS:Defense in Depth
- PHASE:Implementation:Consider adhering to the following rules when allocating and managing an application's memory: Double check that the buffer is as large as specified. When using functions that accept a number of bytes to copy, such as strncpy(), be aware that if the destination buffer size is equal to the source buffer size, it may not NULL-terminate the string. Check buffer boundaries if accessing the buffer in a loop and make sure there is no danger of writing past the allocated space. If necessary, truncate all input strings to a reasonable length before passing them to the copy and concatenation functions.
- PHASE:Operation Build and Compilation:Environment Hardening:Run or compile the software using features or extensions that randomly arrange the positions of a program's executable and libraries in memory. Because this makes the addresses unpredictable, it can prevent an attacker from reliably jumping to exploitable code. Examples include Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) [REF-58] [REF-60] and Position-Independent Executables (PIE) [REF-64]. Imported modules may be similarly realigned if their default memory addresses conflict with other modules, in a process known as rebasing (for Windows) and prelinking (for Linux) [REF-1332] using randomly generated addresses. ASLR for libraries cannot be used in conjunction with prelink since it would require relocating the libraries at run-time, defeating the whole purpose of prelinking. For more information on these techniques see D3-SAOR (Segment Address Offset Randomization) from D3FEND [REF-1335].:EFFECTIVENESS:Defense in Depth
- PHASE:Operation:Environment Hardening:Use a CPU and operating system that offers Data Execution Protection (using hardware NX or XD bits) or the equivalent techniques that simulate this feature in software, such as PaX [REF-60] [REF-61]. These techniques ensure that any instruction executed is exclusively at a memory address that is part of the code segment. For more information on these techniques see D3-PSEP (Process Segment Execution Prevention) from D3FEND [REF-1336].:EFFECTIVENESS:Defense in Depth
- PHASE:Implementation:Replace unbounded copy functions with analogous functions that support length arguments, such as strcpy with strncpy. Create these if they are not available.:EFFECTIVENESS:Moderate
Don't:
- Integrity:Avoid situations leading toModify Memory:Avoid situations leading toExecute Unauthorized Code or Commands:NOTE:Write operations could cause memory corruption. In some cases, an adversary can modify control data such as return addresses in order to execute unexpected code.
- Availability:Avoid situations leading toDoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:NOTE:Attempting to access out-of-range, invalid, or unauthorized memory could cause the product to crash.
- Other:Avoid situations leading toUnexpected State:NOTE:Subsequent write operations can produce undefined or unexpected results.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:This weakness can often be detected using
automated static analysis tools. Many modern tools use data flow analysis or constraint-
based techniques to minimize the number of false positives. Automated static analysis
generally does not account for environmental considerations when reporting out-of-bounds
memory operations. This can make it difficult for users to determine which warnings should
be investigated first. For example, an analysis tool might report buffer overflows that
originate from command line arguments in a program that is not expected to run with setuid
or other special privileges.:EFFECTIVENESS:High::METHOD:Automated Dynamic
Analysis:DESCRIPTION:This weakness can be detected using dynamic tools and techniques that
interact with the software using large test suites with many diverse inputs, such as fuzz
testing (fuzzing), robustness testing, and fault injection. The software's operation may
slow down, but it should not become unstable, crash, or generate incorrect results.::
