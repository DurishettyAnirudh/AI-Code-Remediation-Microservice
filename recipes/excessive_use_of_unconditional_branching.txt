- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Maintainability

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This issue makes it more difficult to understand and/or maintain the product, which
indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or
fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
