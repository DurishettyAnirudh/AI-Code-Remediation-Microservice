cwe: CWE-1084
name: Invokable Control Element with Excessive File or Data Access Operations
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
A function or method contains too many operations that utilize a data manager or file
resource.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Maintainability

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly affects
security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities.
It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities. While the interpretation of too
many operations may vary for each product or developer, CISQ recommends a default maximum
of 7 operations for the same data manager or file.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
