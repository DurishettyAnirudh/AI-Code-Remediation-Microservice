cwe: CWE-1056
name: Invokable Control Element with Variadic Parameters
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
A named-callable or method control element has a signature that supports a variable
(variadic) number of parameters or arguments.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Reliability

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This issue can prevent the product from running reliably. If the relevant code is
reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability.
With variadic arguments, it can be difficult or inefficient for manual analysis to be
certain of which function/method is being invoked.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
