cwe: CWE-431
name: Missing Handler
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
A handler is not available or implemented.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Implementation:Handle all possible situations (e.g. error condition).
- PHASE:Implementation:If an operation can throw an Exception, implement a handler for that specific exception.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toVaries by Context

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
When an exception is thrown and not caught, the process has given up an opportunity to
decide if a given failure or event is worth a change in execution.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):

# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
