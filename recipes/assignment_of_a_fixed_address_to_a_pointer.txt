cwe: CWE-587
name: Assignment of a Fixed Address to a Pointer
languages: C, C++, C#
tags: Draft, Memory Management, Variant
---
Short Description:
The product sets a pointer to a specific address other than NULL or 0.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Implementation:Never set a pointer to a fixed address.
Don't:
- Integrity:Confidentiality:Availability:Avoid situations leading toExecute Unauthorized Code or Commands:NOTE:If one executes code at a known location, an attacker might be able to inject code there beforehand.
- Availability:Avoid situations leading toDoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:Avoid situations leading toReduce Maintainability:Avoid situations leading toReduce Reliability:NOTE:If the code is ported to another platform or environment, the pointer is likely to be invalid and cause a crash.
- Confidentiality:Integrity:Avoid situations leading toRead Memory:Avoid situations leading toModify Memory:NOTE:The data at a known pointer location can be easily read or influenced by an attacker.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Using a fixed address is not portable, because that address will probably not be valid in
all environments or platforms.

::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Never set a pointer to a fixed address.::

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
