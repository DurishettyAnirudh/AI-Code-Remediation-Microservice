cwe: CWE-524
name: Use of Cache Containing Sensitive Information
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The code uses a cache that contains sensitive information, but the cache can be read by an
actor outside of the intended control sphere.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Architecture and Design:Protect information stored in cache.
- PHASE:Architecture and Design:Do not store unnecessarily sensitive information in the cache.
- PHASE:Architecture and Design:Consider using encryption in the cache.
Don't:
- Confidentiality:Avoid situations leading toRead Application Data

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Applications may use caches to improve efficiency when communicating with remote entities
or performing intensive calculations. A cache maintains a pool of objects, threads,
connections, pages, financial data, passwords, or other resources to minimize the time it
takes to initialize and access these resources. If the cache is accessible to unauthorized
actors, attackers can read the cache and obtain this sensitive information.

::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly
referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching
for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks
(destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the
OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
