cwe: CWE-603
name: Use of Client-Side Authentication
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
A client/server product performs authentication within client code but not in server code,
allowing server-side authentication to be bypassed via a modified client that omits the
authentication check.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Architecture and Design:Do not rely on client side data. Always perform server side authentication.
Don't:
- Access Control:Avoid situations leading toBypass Protection Mechanism:Avoid situations leading toGain Privileges or Assume Identity

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Client-side authentication is extremely weak and may be breached easily. Any attacker may
read the source code and reverse-engineer the authentication mechanism to access parts of
the application which would otherwise be protected.

::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Do not rely on client side data. Always
perform server side authentication.::

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
