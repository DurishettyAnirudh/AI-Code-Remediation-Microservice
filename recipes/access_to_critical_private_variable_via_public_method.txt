cwe: CWE-767
name: Access to Critical Private Variable via Public Method
languages: C++, C#, Java
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product defines a public method that reads or modifies a private variable.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Implementation:Use class accessor and mutator methods appropriately. Perform validation when accepting data from a public method that is intended to modify a critical private variable. Also be sure that appropriate access controls are being applied when a public method interfaces with critical data.
Don't:
- Integrity:Other:Avoid situations leading toModify Application Data:Avoid situations leading toOther

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
If an attacker modifies the variable to contain unexpected values, this could violate
assumptions from other parts of the code. Additionally, if an attacker can read the
private variable, it may expose sensitive information or make it easier to launch further
attacks.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):

if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
