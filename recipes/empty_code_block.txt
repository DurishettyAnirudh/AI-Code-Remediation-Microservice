cwe: CWE-1071
name: Empty Code Block
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The source code contains a block that does not contain any code, i.e., the block is empty.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Reliability

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Empty code blocks can occur in the bodies of conditionals, function or method definitions,
exception handlers, etc. While an empty code block might be intentional, it might also
indicate incomplete implementation, accidental code deletion, unexpected macro expansion,
etc. For some programming languages and constructs, an empty block might be allowed by the
syntax, but the lack of any behavior within the block might violate a convention or API in
such a way that it is an error.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
