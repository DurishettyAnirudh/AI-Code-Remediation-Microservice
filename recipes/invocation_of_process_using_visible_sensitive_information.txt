cwe: CWE-214
name: Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete, Program Invocation
---
Short Description:
A process is invoked with sensitive command-line arguments, environment variables, or
other elements that can be seen by other processes on the operating system.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Confidentiality:Avoid situations leading toRead Application Data

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Many operating systems allow a user to list information about processes that are owned by
other users. Other users could see information such as command line arguments or
environment variable settings. When this data contains sensitive information such as
credentials, it might allow other users to launch an attack against the product or related
resources.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
