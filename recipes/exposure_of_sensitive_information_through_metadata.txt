cwe: CWE-1230
name: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Metadata
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product prevents direct access to a resource containing sensitive information, but it
does not sufficiently limit access to metadata that is derived from the original,
sensitive information.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Never trust unbounded input and do not bypass centralized validation.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Developers might correctly prevent unauthorized access to a database or other resource
containing sensitive information, but they might not consider that portions of the
original information might also be recorded in metadata, search indices, statistical
reports, or other resources. If these resources are not also restricted, then attackers
might be able to extract some or all of the original information, or otherwise infer some
details. For example, an attacker could specify search terms that are known to be unique
to a particular person, or view metadata such as activity or creation dates in order to
identify usage patterns.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
