cwe: CWE-323
name: Reusing a Nonce, Key Pair in Encryption
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
Nonces should be used for the present occasion and only once.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Implementation:Refuse to reuse nonce values.
- PHASE:Implementation:Use techniques such as requiring incrementing, time based and/or challenge response to assure uniqueness of nonces.
Don't:
- Access Control:Avoid situations leading toBypass Protection Mechanism:Avoid situations leading toGain Privileges or Assume Identity:NOTE:Potentially a replay attack, in which an attacker could send the same data twice, could be crafted if nonces are allowed to be reused. This could allow a user to send a message which masquerades as a valid message from a valid user.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
