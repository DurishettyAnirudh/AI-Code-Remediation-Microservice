cwe: CWE-476
name: NULL Pointer Dereference
languages: C, C++, Java, C#, Go
tags: Base, Stable
---
Short Description:
The product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Implementation:For any pointers that could have been modified or provided from a function that can return NULL, check the pointer for NULL before use. When working with a multithreaded or otherwise asynchronous environment, ensure that proper locking APIs are used to lock before the check, and unlock when it has finished [REF-1484].
- PHASE:Requirements:Select a programming language that is not susceptible to these issues.
- PHASE:Implementation:Check the results of all functions that return a value and verify that the value is non-null before acting upon it.:EFFECTIVENESS:Moderate
- PHASE:Architecture and Design:Identify all variables and data stores that receive information from external sources, and apply input validation to make sure that they are only initialized to expected values.
- PHASE:Implementation:Explicitly initialize all variables and other data stores, either during declaration or just before the first usage.
Don't:
- Availability:Avoid situations leading toDoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:NOTE:NULL pointer dereferences usually result in the failure of the process unless exception handling (on some platforms) is available and implemented. Even when exception handling is being used, it can still be very difficult to return the software to a safe state of operation.
- Integrity:Confidentiality:Avoid situations leading toExecute Unauthorized Code or Commands:Avoid situations leading toRead Memory:Avoid situations leading toModify Memory:NOTE:In rare circumstances, when NULL is equivalent to the 0x0 memory address and privileged code can access it, then writing or reading memory is possible, which may lead to code execution.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
::METHOD:Automated Dynamic Analysis:DESCRIPTION:This weakness can be detected using
dynamic tools and techniques that interact with the software using large test suites with
many diverse inputs, such as fuzz testing (fuzzing), robustness testing, and fault
injection. The software's operation may slow down, but it should not become unstable,
crash, or generate incorrect results.:EFFECTIVENESS:Moderate::METHOD:Manual Dynamic
Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Identify error conditions that are not likely to occur during normal
usage and trigger them. For example, run the program under low memory conditions, run with
insufficient privileges or permissions, interrupt a transaction before it is completed, or
disable connectivity to basic network services such as DNS. Monitor the software for any
unexpected behavior. If you trigger an unhandled exception or similar error that was
discovered and handled by the application's environment, it may still indicate unexpected
conditions that were not handled by the application itself.::METHOD:Automated Static
Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application
Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code
(or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by
building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable
patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks (destinations where the data
interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS,
etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
