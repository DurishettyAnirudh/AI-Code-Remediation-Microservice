cwe: CWE-1392
name: Use of Default Credentials
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product uses default credentials (such as passwords or cryptographic keys) for
potentially critical functionality.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Requirements:Prohibit use of default, hard-coded, or other values that do not vary for each installation of the product - especially for separate organizations.:EFFECTIVENESS:High
- PHASE:Architecture and Design:Force the administrator to change the credential upon installation.:EFFECTIVENESS:High
- PHASE:Installation Operation:The product administrator could change the defaults upon installation or during operation.:EFFECTIVENESS:Moderate
Don't:
- Authentication:Avoid situations leading toGain Privileges or Assume Identity

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
It is common practice for products to be designed to use default keys, passwords, or other
mechanisms for authentication. The rationale is to simplify the manufacturing process or
the system administrator's task of installation and deployment into an enterprise.
However, if admins do not change the defaults, it is easier for attackers to bypass
authentication quickly across multiple organizations.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):

if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
