cwe: CWE-1046
name: Creation of Immutable Text Using String Concatenation
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product creates an immutable text string using string concatenation operations.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Performance

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
When building a string via a looping feature (e.g., a FOR or WHILE loop), the use of += to
append to the existing string will result in the creation of a new object with each
iteration. This programming pattern can be inefficient in comparison with use of text
buffer data elements. This issue can make the product perform more slowly. If the relevant
code is reachable by an attacker, then this could be influenced to create performance
problem.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
