cwe: CWE-260
name: Password in Configuration File
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product stores a password in a configuration file that might be accessible to actors
who do not know the password.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Architecture and Design:Avoid storing passwords in easily accessible locations.
- PHASE:Architecture and Design:Consider storing cryptographic hashes of passwords as an alternative to storing in plaintext.
Don't:
- Access Control:Avoid situations leading toGain Privileges or Assume Identity

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This can result in compromise of the system for which the password is used. An attacker
could gain access to this file and learn the stored password or worse yet, change the
password to one of their choosing.

::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly
referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching
for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks
(destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the
OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
