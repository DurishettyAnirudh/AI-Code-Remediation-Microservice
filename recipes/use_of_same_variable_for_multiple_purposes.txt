cwe: CWE-1109
name: Use of Same Variable for Multiple Purposes
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The code contains a callable, block, or other code element in which the same variable is
used to control more than one unique task or store more than one instance of data.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Maintainability

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Use of the same variable for multiple purposes can make it more difficult for a person to
read or understand the code, potentially hiding other quality issues. This issue makes it
more difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it
more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it
easier to introduce vulnerabilities.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
