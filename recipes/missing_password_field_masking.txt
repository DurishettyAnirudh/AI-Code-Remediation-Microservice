cwe: CWE-549
name: Missing Password Field Masking
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
The product does not mask passwords during entry, increasing the potential for attackers
to observe and capture passwords.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Implementation Requirements:Recommendations include requiring all password fields in your web application be masked to prevent other users from seeing this information.
Don't:
- Access Control:Avoid situations leading toBypass Protection Mechanism

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly
referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching
for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks
(destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the
OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::

::PHASE:Implementation Requirements:DESCRIPTION:Recommendations include requiring all
password fields in your web application be masked to prevent other users from seeing this
information.::

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
