cwe: CWE-1235
name: Incorrect Use of Autoboxing and Unboxing for Performance Critical Operations
languages: Java, C#
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The code uses boxed primitives, which may introduce inefficiencies into performance-
critical operations.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Implementation:Use of boxed primitives should be limited to certain situations such as when calling methods with typed parameters. Examine the use of boxed primitives prior to use. Use SparseArrays or ArrayMap instead of HashMap to avoid performance overhead.
Don't:
- Availability:Avoid situations leading toDoS: Resource Consumption (CPU):Avoid situations leading toDoS: Resource Consumption (Memory):Avoid situations leading toDoS: Resource Consumption (Other):Avoid situations leading toReduce Performance:LIKELIHOOD:Low:NOTE:Incorrect autoboxing/unboxing would result in reduced performance, which sometimes can lead to resource consumption issues.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Languages such as Java and C# support automatic conversion through their respective
compilers from primitive types into objects of the corresponding wrapper classes, and vice
versa. For example, a compiler might convert an int to Integer (called autoboxing) or an
Integer to int (called unboxing). This eliminates forcing the programmer to perform these
conversions manually, which makes the code cleaner. However, this feature comes at a cost
of performance and can lead to resource exhaustion and impact availability when used with
generic collections. Therefore, they should not be used for scientific computing or other
performance critical operations. They are only suited to support impedance mismatch
between reference types and primitives.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
