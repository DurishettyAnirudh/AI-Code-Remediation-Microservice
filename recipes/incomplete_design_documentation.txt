cwe: CWE-1110
name: Incomplete Design Documentation
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product's design documentation does not adequately describe control flow, data flow,
system initialization, relationships between tasks, components, rationales, or other
important aspects of the design.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Never trust unbounded input and do not bypass centralized validation.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Document detection techniques and mitigation steps for this weakness.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
