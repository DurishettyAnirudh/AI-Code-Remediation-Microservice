cwe: CWE-1097
name: Persistent Storable Data Element without Associated Comparison Control Element
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product uses a storable data element that does not have all of the associated
functions or methods that are necessary to support comparison.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Reliability

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
For example, with Java, a class that is made persistent requires both hashCode() and
equals() methods to be defined. This issue can prevent the product from running reliably,
due to incorrect or unexpected comparison results. If the relevant code is reachable by an
attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
