cwe: CWE-832
name: Unlock of a Resource that is not Locked
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product attempts to unlock a resource that is not locked.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Integrity:Confidentiality:Availability:Other:Avoid situations leading toDoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:Avoid situations leading toExecute Unauthorized Code or Commands:Avoid situations leading toModify Memory:Avoid situations leading toOther:NOTE:Depending on the locking being used, an unlock operation might not have any adverse effects. When effects exist, the most common consequence will be a corruption of the state of the product, possibly leading to a crash or exit; depending on the implementation of the unlocking, memory corruption or code execution could occur.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Depending on the locking functionality, an unlock of a non-locked resource might cause
memory corruption or other modification to the resource (or its associated metadata that
is used for tracking locks).

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
