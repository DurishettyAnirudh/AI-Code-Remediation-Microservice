cwe: CWE-1118
name: Insufficient Documentation of Error Handling Techniques
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The documentation does not sufficiently describe the techniques that are used for error
handling, exception processing, or similar mechanisms.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Never trust unbounded input and do not bypass centralized validation.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Documentation may need to cover error handling techniques at multiple layers, such as
module, executable, compilable code unit, or callable.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
