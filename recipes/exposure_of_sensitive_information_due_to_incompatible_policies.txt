cwe: CWE-213
name: Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
The product's intended functionality exposes information to certain actors in accordance
with the developer's security policy, but this information is regarded as sensitive
according to the intended security policies of other stakeholders such as the product's
administrator, users, or others whose information is being processed.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Confidentiality:Avoid situations leading toRead Application Data

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
When handling information, the developer must consider whether the information is regarded
as sensitive by different stakeholders, such as users or administrators. Each stakeholder
effectively has its own intended security policy that the product is expected to uphold.
When a developer does not treat that information as sensitive, this can introduce a
vulnerability that violates the expectations of the product's users.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
