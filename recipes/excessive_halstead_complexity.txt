cwe: CWE-1122
name: Excessive Halstead Complexity
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The code is structured in a way that a Halstead complexity measure exceeds a desirable
maximum.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Maintainability

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
A variety of Halstead complexity measures exist, such as program vocabulary size or
volume. This issue makes it more difficult to understand and/or maintain the product,
which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find
and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
