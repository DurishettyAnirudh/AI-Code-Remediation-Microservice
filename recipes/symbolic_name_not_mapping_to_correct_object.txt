cwe: CWE-386
name: Symbolic Name not Mapping to Correct Object
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
A constant symbolic reference to an object is used, even though the reference can resolve
to a different object over time.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Access Control:Avoid situations leading toGain Privileges or Assume Identity:NOTE:The attacker can gain access to otherwise unauthorized resources.
- Integrity:Confidentiality:Other:Avoid situations leading toModify Application Data:Avoid situations leading toModify Files or Directories:Avoid situations leading toRead Application Data:Avoid situations leading toRead Files or Directories:Avoid situations leading toOther:NOTE:Race conditions such as this kind may be employed to gain read or write access to resources not normally readable or writable by the user in question.
- Integrity:Other:Avoid situations leading toModify Application Data:Avoid situations leading toOther:NOTE:The resource in question, or other resources (through the corrupted one) may be changed in undesirable ways by a malicious user.
- Non-Repudiation:Avoid situations leading toHide Activities:NOTE:If a file or other resource is written in this method, as opposed to a valid way, logging of the activity may not occur.
- Non-Repudiation:Integrity:Avoid situations leading toModify Files or Directories:NOTE:In some cases it may be possible to delete files that a malicious user might not otherwise have access to -- such as log files.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Document detection techniques and mitigation steps for this weakness.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
