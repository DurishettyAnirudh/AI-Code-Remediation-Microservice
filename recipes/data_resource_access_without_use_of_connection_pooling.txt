cwe: CWE-1072
name: Data Resource Access without Use of Connection Pooling
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product accesses a data resource through a database without using a connection pooling
capability.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Performance

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This issue can make the product perform more slowly, as connection pools allow connections
to be reused without the overhead and time consumption of opening and closing a new
connection. If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this performance
problem might introduce a vulnerability.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
