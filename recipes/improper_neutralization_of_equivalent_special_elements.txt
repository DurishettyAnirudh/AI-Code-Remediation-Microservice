cwe: CWE-76
name: Improper Neutralization of Equivalent Special Elements
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
The product correctly neutralizes certain special elements, but it improperly neutralizes
equivalent special elements.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Requirements:Programming languages and supporting technologies might be chosen which are not subject to these issues.
- PHASE:Implementation:Utilize an appropriate mix of allowlist and denylist parsing to filter equivalent special element syntax from all input.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toOther

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
The product may have a fixed list of special characters it believes is complete. However,
there may be alternate encodings, or representations that also have the same meaning. For
example, the product may filter out a leading slash (/) to prevent absolute path names,
but does not account for a tilde (~) followed by a user name, which on some *nix systems
could be expanded to an absolute pathname. Alternately, the product might filter a
dangerous -e command-line switch when calling an external program, but it might not
account for --exec or other switches that have the same semantics.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):

# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
