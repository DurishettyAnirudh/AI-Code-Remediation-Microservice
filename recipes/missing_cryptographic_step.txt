cwe: CWE-325
name: Missing Cryptographic Step
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Cryptography, Draft
---
Short Description:
The product does not implement a required step in a cryptographic algorithm, resulting in
weaker encryption than advertised by the algorithm.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Access Control:Avoid situations leading toBypass Protection Mechanism
- Confidentiality:Integrity:Avoid situations leading toRead Application Data:Avoid situations leading toModify Application Data
- Accountability:Non-Repudiation:Avoid situations leading toHide Activities

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Document detection techniques and mitigation steps for this weakness.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
