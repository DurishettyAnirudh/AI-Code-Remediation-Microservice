cwe: CWE-272
name: Least Privilege Violation
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The elevated privilege level required to perform operations such as chroot() should be
dropped immediately after the operation is performed.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Architecture and Design Operation:Very carefully manage the setting, management, and handling of privileges. Explicitly manage trust zones in the software.
- PHASE:Architecture and Design:Separation of Privilege:Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning access rights to entities in a software system.
- PHASE:Architecture and Design:Separation of Privilege:Compartmentalize the system to have safe areas where trust boundaries can be unambiguously drawn. Do not allow sensitive data to go outside of the trust boundary and always be careful when interfacing with a compartment outside of the safe area. Ensure that appropriate compartmentalization is built into the system design, and the compartmentalization allows for and reinforces privilege separation functionality. Architects and designers should rely on the principle of least privilege to decide the appropriate time to use privileges and the time to drop privileges.
Don't:
- Access Control:Confidentiality:Avoid situations leading toGain Privileges or Assume Identity:Avoid situations leading toRead Application Data:Avoid situations leading toRead Files or Directories:NOTE:An attacker may be able to access resources with the elevated privilege that could not be accessed with the attacker's original privileges. This is particularly likely in conjunction with another flaw, such as a buffer overflow.
