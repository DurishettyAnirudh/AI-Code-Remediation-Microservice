cwe: CWE-1087
name: Class with Virtual Method without a Virtual Destructor
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
A class contains a virtual method, but the method does not have an associated virtual
destructor.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Reliability

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This issue can prevent the product from running reliably, e.g. due to undefined behavior.
If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might
introduce a vulnerability.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
