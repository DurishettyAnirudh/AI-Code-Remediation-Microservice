cwe: CWE-1094
name: Excessive Index Range Scan for a Data Resource
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product contains an index range scan for a large data table, but the scan can cover a
large number of rows.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Performance

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
This issue can make the product perform more slowly. If the relevant code is reachable by
an attacker, then this performance problem might introduce a vulnerability. While the
interpretation of large data table and excessive index range may vary for each product or
developer, CISQ recommends a threshold of 1000000 table rows and a threshold of 10 for the
index range.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
