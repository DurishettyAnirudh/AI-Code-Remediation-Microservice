cwe: CWE-248
name: Uncaught Exception
languages: C++, Java, C#
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
An exception is thrown from a function, but it is not caught.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Availability:Confidentiality:Avoid situations leading toDoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart:Avoid situations leading toRead Application Data:NOTE:An uncaught exception could cause the system to be placed in a state that could lead to a crash, exposure of sensitive information or other unintended behaviors.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
When an exception is not caught, it may cause the program to crash or expose sensitive
information.

::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly
referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching
for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks
(destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the
OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
