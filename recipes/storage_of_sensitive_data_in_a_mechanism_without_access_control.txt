cwe: CWE-921
name: Storage of Sensitive Data in a Mechanism without Access Control
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product stores sensitive information in a file system or device that does not have
built-in access control.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Confidentiality:Avoid situations leading toRead Application Data:Avoid situations leading toRead Files or Directories:NOTE:Attackers can read sensitive information by accessing the unrestricted storage mechanism.
- Integrity:Avoid situations leading toModify Application Data:Avoid situations leading toModify Files or Directories:NOTE:Attackers can modify or delete sensitive information by accessing the unrestricted storage mechanism.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
While many modern file systems or devices utilize some form of access control in order to
restrict access to data, not all storage mechanisms have this capability. For example,
memory cards, floppy disks, CDs, and USB devices are typically made accessible to any user
within the system. This can become a problem when sensitive data is stored in these
mechanisms in a multi-user environment, because anybody on the system can read or write
this data. On Android devices, external storage is typically globally readable and
writable by other applications on the device. External storage may also be easily
accessible through the mobile device's USB connection or physically accessible through the
device's memory card port.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
