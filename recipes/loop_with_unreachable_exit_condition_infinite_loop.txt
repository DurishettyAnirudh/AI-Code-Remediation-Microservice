cwe: CWE-835
name: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The product contains an iteration or loop with an exit condition that cannot be reached,
i.e., an infinite loop.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Availability:Avoid situations leading toDoS: Resource Consumption (CPU):Avoid situations leading toDoS: Resource Consumption (Memory):Avoid situations leading toDoS: Amplification:NOTE:An infinite loop will cause unexpected consumption of resources, such as CPU cycles or memory. The software's operation may slow down, or cause a long time to respond.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Document detection techniques and mitigation steps for this weakness.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
