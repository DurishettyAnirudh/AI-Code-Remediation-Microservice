Short Description:
The product, when processing trusted data, accepts any untrusted data that is also

- Access Control:Integrity:Avoid situations leading toBypass Protection Mechanism:Avoid situations leading toModify Application Data:NOTE:An attacker could package untrusted data with trusted data to bypass protection mechanisms to gain access to and possibly modify sensitive data.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
Document detection techniques and mitigation steps for this weakness.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
