cwe: CWE-1048
name: Invokable Control Element with Large Number of Outward Calls
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Incomplete
---
Short Description:
The code contains callable control elements that contain an excessively large number of
references to other application objects external to the context of the callable, i.e. a
Fan-Out value that is excessively large.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toReduce Maintainability

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
While the interpretation of excessively large Fan-Out value may vary for each product or
developer, CISQ recommends a default of 5 referenced objects. This issue makes it more
difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more
difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it
easier to introduce vulnerabilities.

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
