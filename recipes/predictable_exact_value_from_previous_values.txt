cwe: CWE-342
name: Predictable Exact Value from Previous Values
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
An exact value or random number can be precisely predicted by observing previous values.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Increase the entropy used to seed a PRNG.
- PHASE:Architecture and Design Requirements:Libraries or Frameworks:Use products or modules that conform to FIPS 140-2 [REF-267] to avoid obvious entropy problems. Consult FIPS 140-2 Annex C (Approved Random Number Generators).
- PHASE:Implementation:Use a PRNG that periodically re-seeds itself using input from high-quality sources, such as hardware devices with high entropy. However, do not re-seed too frequently, or else the entropy source might block.
Don't:
- Other:Avoid situations leading toVaries by Context

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
