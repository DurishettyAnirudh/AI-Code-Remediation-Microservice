cwe: CWE-455
name: Non-exit on Failed Initialization
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
The product does not exit or otherwise modify its operation when security-relevant errors
occur during initialization, such as when a configuration file has a format error or a
hardware security module (HSM) cannot be activated, which can cause the product to execute
in a less secure fashion than intended by the administrator.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- PHASE:Implementation:Follow the principle of failing securely when an error occurs. The system should enter a state where it is not vulnerable and will not display sensitive error messages to a potential attacker.
Don't:
- Integrity:Other:Avoid situations leading toModify Application Data:Avoid situations leading toAlter Execution Logic:NOTE:The application could be placed in an insecure state that may allow an attacker to modify sensitive data or allow unintended logic to be executed.

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Follow the principle of failing securely when an error
occurs. The system should enter a state where it is not vulnerable and will not display
sensitive error messages to a potential attacker.::

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
