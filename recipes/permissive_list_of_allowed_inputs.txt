cwe: CWE-183
name: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs
languages: unspecified
tags: Base, Draft
---
Short Description:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or
properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed
to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe,
leading to resultant weaknesses.

Secure Coding Checklist:
Do:
- Apply least privilege, validate input, and follow vendor hardening guides.
Don't:
- Access Control:Avoid situations leading toBypass Protection Mechanism

Language-Agnostic Guidance:
::METHOD:Automated Static Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Automated static analysis, commonly
referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this
weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching
for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect sources (origins of input) with sinks
(destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the
OS, etc.):EFFECTIVENESS:High::

Sample Fix Idea (Pseudo-code):
```pseudo
# High-level remediation stub
if receives_untrusted_input():
    validate_against_allowlist()
    enforce_least_privilege()
    log_and_monitor()
```
